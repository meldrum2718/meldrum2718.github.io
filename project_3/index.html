            <h3> Defining Correspondences </h3>

            <p> I built a lightweight selection tool that allows for selecting
            corresponding points between two separate images.

            <h3> Image interpolation </h3>
            <p> In order to implement the image warping algorithm, I first
            implemented a Bilinear interpolation algorithm that treats an image
            as a function with domain in [0, 1]^2. This simplification of
            coordinates simplifies indexing later in the warping algorithm. The
            bilinear interpolation is implemented simply as two linear
            interpolations: sampling our function at a location (x1, x2), is in
            general not on a pixel value. So we look at the 4 neighboring pixel
            values. Then we perform two interpolations horizontally, across the
            top and across the bottom of the enclosing square, to approximate
            the function value at x2. Then we perform a vertical linear
            interpolation between these two values to finally find the value of
            the bilinear interpolation at (x1, x2).
            <p>

            <h3> Triangulating and Warping, and the midway face </h3>


            <p>
            Then, we use a Delaunay triangulation on the averages of the
            corresponding points to partition the images into triangles. Now, to
            compute a warped image we start with the coordinates of the regular
            (h, w) grid in [0, 1]^2, and think of each one of these coordinates
            as a "measurement location" where we are going to sample the image
            to form a pixel value.
            <p>

            <p>
            Now, each pixel lies in one of the triangles. And our
            correspondences define maps between the triangles. A standard fact
            tells us that there is a unique affine transformation that maps the
            vertices of one nondegenerate triangle to another nondegenerate
            triangle. We compute this affine transformation as a linear map in R^3 on an affine subspace.
            P1 @ P0^{-1} (observe A P0 = P1 implies A = P1 P0^{-1}), where P1
            and P0 are the 3x3 matrices representing the source and target
            triangles lying on the affine subspace z = 1 in R^3, and then
            projecting the points back down into R^2 for input into the linear
            interpolation.
            <p>

            <p>
            So we transform each pixel coordinate according to the affine
            transformation defined by its enclosing triangle. And then we sample
            from the interpolation with our transformed coordinates to obtain
            the final warped image.
            <p>

            <p>
            Here, we show a midway point in this computation:

            <h3> Image Morph Sequences </h3>
            <p> In order to morph between images, we perform a linear
            interpolation from our source point set to our target point set. We
            then warp both images to the points obtained in the interpolation,
            and compute a weighted average of the two warped images, with
            weight coming from the paramater in the linear interpolation.
            <p>

            <h3> Face Dataset Averaging </h3>
            <p> Next, we look at finding an average face from an image dataset.
            We use the FEI Face Database Spatially normalized frontal images,
            and the provided manual alignment. We look at the subsets of the
            faces in the dataset that are smiling and those that are not, and
            we additionally divide the dataset up into those including glasses
            and those that do not.

            We then compute the average face for each of these four subsets. We
            compute the average similarly as in the morph sequence, only now we
            are warping annotated points to their average locations and then
            taking the element wise averege of the warped images to give the
            final average image in the dataset.

            <h3> Face Warping and Extrapolation </h3>
            <p> Then I warp an image of myself into the geometry of the average
            face, and I warp the average face into the geometry of my face.
            Additionally, I display an animation of the warping of the average
            face, but extrapolating beyond convex combinations of the
            corresponding points. Due to medical reasons, I look straight ahead
            with a slightly turned head (hence take photos with a slightly
            turned head), and in these warpings the misalignment of my head is
            particularly noticable.

            <h3> Continuous warping with differential equations. </h3>

            <p>
            Next, we look at performing continuous deformations to an image
            with by letting the pixels sampling coordinates evolve according to
            an ODE. This is interesting because of the connections between
            differential equations and differential geometry. In this project,
            I implement an interactive visualization of such transformations
            with sliders that control the paramaters for the differential
            equation that governs the image transformation.
            <p>

            <p>
            A quadratic differential equation with terms given by the porduct of the coefficients of theta with the terms of (1 + xi + xj)(1 + xi + xj)
            governs the image transformation. Furthermore, we impose a boundary
            contition that ensures that the points on the edge of the image
            remain stationary under the differential equation, since this produces more interesting results.
            I simulated the ODE with a simple implementation of Eulers method.
            <p>

            <p>
            In the future it will be intersting to explore more of this
            connection, and potentially learnging differential equations that
            correspond to particular image transformations (i.e. learn
            differential equations that approximates some video)
